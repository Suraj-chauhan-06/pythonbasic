        "\n",
        "Iterables\n",
        "An iterable is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time. It can be \"iterated over\" in a loop, such as a for loop. In simple terms, an iterable is an object that implements the __iter__() method or has a __getitem__() method that allows sequential access to its elements.\n",

        "    print(item)  # Output: 1, 2, 3\n",
        "Iterators\n",
        "An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data and supports two methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "__iter__() which returns the iterator object itself (so it can be used in a loop).\n",
        "__next__() which returns the next element from the data and raises a StopIteration exception when there are no more elements.\n",
        "Iterators are created from iterables. When you call iter() on an iterable, it returns an iterator that you can use to iterate over the elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",

        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",

        "An iterable is any object that can return an iterator using the iter() function.\n",
        "Examples: lists, strings, sets, dictionaries.\n",
        "It can be iterated over, but it does not necessarily implement the __next__() method itself.\n",
        "Iterator:\n",
        "\n",
        "An iterator is an object that not only returns its elements one at a time but also keeps track of the current state during the iteration.\n",
        "An iterator implements both __iter__() and __next__().\n",
        "It allows the iteration to be done manually using next() and stops when the StopIteration exception is raised.\n",
        "Example to Demonstrate:\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "# Example of iterable\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer = In Python, generators are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples, but they generate values on the fly instead of storing them in memory. This makes generators more memory-efficient when working with large datasets, as they produce items one at a time when requested (using lazy evaluation).\n",

        "\n",
        "Using a generator function (with yield): A generator function looks similar to a regular function, but instead of using return to send a value back, it uses the yield keyword. When a generator function is called, it doesn't run the function body immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over. Each time the generator function's yield statement is executed, the function's state is saved, and it can be resumed from that point the next time the generator is iterated.\n",

        "The generator expression (x * x for x in range(1, 6)) generates the square of each number from 1 to 5 when iterated.\n",
        "Key Points About Generators:\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Generators produce values one at a time and only when requested, which makes them more memory-efficient compared to lists.\n",
        "State Preservation: When a generator function yields a value, it saves its state and resumes where it left off when the next value is requested.\n",
        "Iteration: Generators can be iterated using a for loop or with functions like next() to retrieve values.\n",
        "Benefits of Generators:\n",
        "Memory Efficiency: Since values are generated on the fly, they don't require storing the entire sequence in memory.\n",
        "Performance: Generators can be more efficient in scenarios where you don't need to store all the results at once or where you only need to process one item at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer = 1. Memory Efficiency:\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: A generator produces values one at a time using the yield keyword, which means it doesn’t need to store all values in memory. This is especially useful for iterating over large datasets or streams of data, as it only generates values as they are requested.\n",
        "Reduced Memory Usage: In contrast, a regular function often returns all values at once, which could require large amounts of memory.\n",
        "2. Performance Optimization:\n",
        "On-the-Fly Computation: Since generators compute each value only when needed (and not all at once), they can be more efficient in scenarios where not all results are required immediately, or only a subset of results will be processed.\n",
        "Faster Start-Up: Since generators yield values one at a time, they often allow for faster startup, as they don’t need to compute everything up front.\n",
        "3. Control Over Iteration:\n",
        "State Persistence: A generator maintains its state between calls. Each time the generator function is called, it resumes from the last yield statement, rather than starting over. This allows for more fine-grained control over iteration without having to explicitly manage the state.\n",
        "Infinite Sequences: Generators can represent potentially infinite sequences (e.g., an endless stream of data), whereas a regular function would be limited to returning finite lists or collections.\n",
        "4. Cleaner and More Readable Code:\n",
        "Simplified Code: Generators can replace complex iterative loops, making code more readable and often reducing the need for explicit state management or manual iteration.\n",
        "Pipelining: Generators can be chained together to form pipelines, passing data through multiple stages without needing to create intermediate collections.\n",
        "5. Improved Concurrency:\n",
        "Cooperative Multitasking: While not strictly designed for concurrency, generators can be used to implement cooperative multitasking, where you can pause a function at a yield and later resume it. This is especially useful in some asynchronous programming patterns.\n",
        "6. Better Exception Handling:\n",
        "Error Propagation: You can use try-except blocks within a generator to handle errors more gracefully. When an exception is raised inside a generator, it can be caught, and the generator can continue yielding or clean up appropriately.\n",

        "\n",
        " Answer = A lambda function in Python is an anonymous, small, and simple function defined using the lambda keyword instead of the traditional def keyword. Lambda functions can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. The result of the expression is implicitly returned.\n",

        "Syntax:\n",

        "print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8\n",
        "When to use a lambda function:\n",
        "Short, simple functions: If the function is small and used only once or twice, using a lambda function is more concise and often preferred.\n",
        "In functional programming constructs: Lambda functions are frequently used with functions like map(), filter(), and reduce(), where you need to pass a simple function as an argument.\n",

        "Key Characteristics:\n",
        "Anonymous: They are often used where defining a full function would seem unnecessary.\n",
        "Single expression: A lambda can only contain a single expression and cannot have statements or multiple expressions.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. map():\n",
        "Purpose: Applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list) and returns a map object (an iterator).\n",

        "print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "In this example, map() applies the lambda function to each element of the numbers list and returns an iterator that produces the squared values.\n",

        "Purpose: Applies a given function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, reducing the iterable to a single value.\n",
