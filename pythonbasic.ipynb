        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        "\n",
        "answer-  Python is a programming language that helps you tell a computer what to do using simple, easy-to-understand instructions. Think of it like giving the computer a list of tasks written in a way that's almost like writing a story in English.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer- In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. It translates the code you write into actions that the computer can understand and perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like a translator: when you give the interpreter Python instructions (in the form of code), it translates those into something the computer can execute immediately. Unlike a compiler (which translates the entire code all at once), an interpreter does this one step at a time, which makes it easier for you to see the result of your code as it runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer-  In Python, predefined keywords (also known as reserved words) are words that have a special meaning in the language. You cannot use them as names for variables, functions, or classes. These keywords are part of the syntax of the language, and Python uses them to perform certain tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer- No, keywords in programming languages cannot be used as variable names. Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in the language's syntax, and they are used to define the structure and behavior of the program. Since they are predefined, using them as variable names would cause errors in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANswer-  In Python, mutability refers to whether the contents of an object can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable objects can be changed after creation. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists\n",
        "Dictionaries\n",
        "Sets\n",
        "You can modify their contents, like adding or removing items.\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable objects cannot be changed once they are created. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Strings\n",
        "Tuples\n",
        "Integers\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer-   The key difference between lists and tuples comes down to their design and intended use:\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists (Mutable): Lists are designed to be flexible and changeable. You can modify a list by adding, removing, or changing elements after it’s created. This makes lists useful when you need to work with data that might change over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples (Immutable): Tuples are designed to be fixed and unchangeable after they are created. Once a tuple is defined, you can't add, remove, or modify its elements. This makes tuples useful for situations where you want to ensure that the data stays constant and unchanged, providing safety and stability in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer-  In Python, the == and is operators are used for comparison, but they do so in different ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "== (Equality Operator):\n",
        "\n",
        "Compares the values of two objects.\n",
        "It checks if the contents or data of the two objects are the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "is (Identity Operator):\n",
        "\n",
        "Compares the identity (memory address) of two objects.\n",
        "It checks if both variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer -  In Python, logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions and check if they are true or false. The three main logical operators in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "and: This operator returns True if both conditions are true. If any one of the conditions is false, it returns False.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: True and False will return False.\n",
        "or: This operator returns True if at least one of the conditions is true. It only returns False if both conditions are false.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: True or False will return True.\n",
        "not: This operator reverses the result of a condition. If the condition is true, not makes it false; if the condition is false, not makes it true.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: not True will return False.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer-  1. Implicit Type Casting (Automatic):\n",
        "This happens automatically when Python converts a smaller data type to a larger one. For example, converting an integer to a float. You don’t need to do anything, Python does it for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit Type Casting (Manual):\n",
        "This is when you explicitly tell Python to convert one data type to another using functions like int(), float(), or str().\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer - Implicit Type Casting (Automatic):\n",
        "\n",
        "The computer does this automatically.\n",
        "Happens when converting from a smaller data type to a larger one (e.g., from int to float).\n",
        "You don’t have to do anything, it’s handled by the programming language.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit Type Casting (Manual):\n",
        "\n",
        "The programmer tells the computer how to convert the data type.\n",
        "You need to use a specific function or method to convert the type.\n",
        "Happens when converting from a larger data type to a smaller one (e.g., from float to int), or when you want more control over the conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer-- Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in your code based on certain conditions. They allow your program to choose different actions depending on whether a specific condition is true or false. This is how your program can \"decide\" what to do next.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer -- The elif statement is a way to check multiple conditions in Python, and it stands for \"else if.\" It allows you to check additional conditions after an initial if statement. Here's how it works in a simple way:\n",
        "\n",
        "if statement: First, you check a condition. If it is True, the code inside that block runs.\n",
        "elif statement: If the if condition is False, the program checks the elif condition. If this is True, the code inside the elif block runs.\n",
        "else statement: If none of the above conditions are true, the else block runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer -- The main difference between a for loop and a while loop comes down to how they are used to repeat actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For Loop:\n",
        "Used when you know the number of times you want to repeat an action.\n",
        "It has a counter that starts at a certain number, repeats while a condition is true, and then stops when the condition is no longer true.\n",
        "\n",
        "While Loop:\n",
        "Used when you don't know how many times you need to repeat an action, but you want to repeat it as long as a condition is true.\n",
        "It keeps repeating until the condition becomes false.\n",
        "\n",
        "14 . Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer -- A while loop is more suitable when you don't know in advance how many times the loop will run and you want it to continue as long as a certain condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Imagine you're waiting for your internet connection to work. You don't know how long it will take, but you want to keep trying until the connection is successful. In this case, a while loop is perfect because the loop continues checking the condition (whether the internet is connected) and only stops once it's true."
